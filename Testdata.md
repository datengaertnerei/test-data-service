## Faker

Faker is the obvious choice for random data with a wide range of data types and localization support. It is available for various different programming languages. Faker is ok as long as you do not need valid(!) data for certain purposes like postal addresses, IBANs for current accounts or credit card numbers. That is the only downside I know.
